                <p>In the <a href="micros.html">micronutrients section</a>, for each micronutirent, you'll find some food sources. Try to include these foods in your diet.</p>

                            Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy people.</p>

                            <p>
                            The body stores fat soluble vitamins in fatty tissue and they’re absorbed more easily in the presence of dietary fat.
                            Because the body doesn’t store water soluble vitamins, you need to make sure you regularly consume enough of them through your diet.</p>
