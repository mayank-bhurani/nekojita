                        Most carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose, which is the main energy source for our bodies. A lot of organs require glucose to function properly.

                        We’ll divide carbohydrates into three parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Simple carbohydrates are broken down or metabolized very quickly. These include foods like sugar, honey, refined flour, processed grains.</li>
                            <li>Complex carbohydrates require more time for your body to breakdown. These include foods such as rice, whole grains, vegetables.</li>
                            <li>Fiber or roughage are the carbohydrates which can’t be broken down by you’re body but are really helpful for a healthy <a href="gut-microbiome.html">gut microbiome</a>.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                        Complex carbohydrates like vegetables and whole grains are really beneficial for the body. Most complex carbohydrates won’t cause and instant spike in the blood sugar levels. They’ll also have good quantity of dietary fibers in them.</p>

                    <p>Simple carbohydrates like sugars can cause an instant spike in the blood sugar levels and when consumed too much for prolonged periods, can lead to diseases like Type-2 Diabetes.

                <p>Protein is responsible for the growth of the body and repairing of tissues as wells protecting muscles.</p>

                <p>Protein is composed of amino acids which can be further divided into two parts: essential and non-essential.</p>
                    
                <p>Non-essential amino acids are usually produced by the body and are not required to be consumed through a diet.</p>
                    
                <p>Sources for essential amino acids include, lentils, beans, seeds, nuts, some whole grains, meat, fish, egg, milk and cheese.</p>

                <p>Fats are essential for the body. They allow us to store energy, protect organs by forming a cushion, produce certain hormones as well as absorb fat soluble vitamins.</p>

                <p>Fats are highly researched topic. However without making things too complicated, let’s take a brief overview of the different kinds of fats.</p>
                    
                <p>Fats can be further divided in three kinds:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unsaturated Fats which include Monounsaturated fat and Polyunsaturated fat</li>
                        <li>Saturated Fat</li>
                        <li>Trans Fat</li>
                    </ol>
            <p>Unsaturated fats are considered healthier than saturated fats. However the body needs both of these. The key lies in moderation.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that you consume more of unsaturated fats and less of saturated fats.</p>
                        
            <p>Avoid highly processed foods with trans fats.</p>
                        
            <p>Healthy sources for fats include dairy products like avocado, coconut and coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, nuts and seeds, nut butters, unprocessed dark chocolates, ghee, cheese, eggs, fish and meat.</p>
                        
            <p>Remember your body needs all three of these. Each of them have specific functions that enable the body to operate in a proper manner.</p>
